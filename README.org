Combination of 
[[https://github.com/sesamemucho/ssmm-ansible-arch-install][sesamemucho/ssmm-ansible-arch-install]] and
[[https://github.com/sesamemucho/ssmm-ansible-home][sesamemucho/ssmm-ansible-home]] plus changes.
This project produces base images for a Raspberry Pi and an
Intel-based Arch Linux PC. Using one of the base images, the project
can then install ArchLinux, customized per hostname.

The above repos were originally forked from
[[jsf9k/ansible-arch-install][https://github.com/jsf9k/ansible-arch-install]] and 
[[jsf9k/ansible-home][https://github.com/jsf9k/ansible-home]].
