This project produces base images for a Raspberry Pi and an
Intel-based Arch Linux PC. Using one of the base images, the project
can then install ArchLinux, customized per hostname.

The above repos were originally forked from

At some point, we will want to talk to the internet from the archiso
QEMU VM. Probably a couple of scripts, to keep things simple.
